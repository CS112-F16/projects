Project 5 - Option 1 - Car DB
=============================

### Due Wednesday, November 30, 2016 - 5:00pm
*May be submitted without penalty until Wednesday December 7, 2016 at 5pm.*

**This Project 5 option is worth a maximum of 80/100 points.**

For this project, you will modify your *complete and correct* [Project 3](project3.md) solution so that it *does not use arrays and does not use any of the classes in `java.util` except `Scanner`*. 

### Requirements

1. You will implement your own `LinkedList` class. Your class may *not* use any of the classes from the Java Collections Framework. Your class must support an `add` method that will insert a new item into the list maintaining the list in sorted order. You will also need to add any additional methods required to support the Project 3 functionality.
2. You will modify your `CarList` to use your `LinkedList` class rather than an array to maintain your database of `Car` objects.
3. You will make sure that all functionality required for [Project 3](project3.md) has been implemented correctly. You are encouraged to meet with the instructor to discuss your Project 3 solution before beginning this assignment.
4. Note that you may need to modify other portions of your code (for example your Driver) to support the use of a `LinkedList`. Your grade will depend on how well you design your new solution.
