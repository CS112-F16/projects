Project 5 - Option 2 - Music Player
===================================

### Due Wednesday, November 30, 2016 - 5:00pm
*May be submitted without penalty until Wednesday December 7, 2016 at 5pm.*

**This Project 5 option is worth a maximum of 100/100 points.**

For this project, you will implement an iTunes-like program that plays MP3s.  

### Requirements

1. The absolute path of a directory will be passed as input to the program at the command line.  A sample launch of the program would look as follows: `java MusicPlayerDriver /Users/srollins/mymusic`
2. At startup, the program will *recursively* traverse the given directory and build a list of all MP3 files that appear in the directory or any directory that is a descendant of the directory provided.
3. The user will be presented with a text menu offering the following options:
  1. List all MP3s sorted by song title
  2. List all MP3s sorted by artist
  3. Play MP3 - if the user selects this option, you will need to also ask the user to select the MP3 he/she wishes to play
  4. Stop playback - a song is playing, stop playback.  If no song is playing, do nothing.
  5. Exit the program
4. For full credit, you must demonstrate your complete and working solution to the instructor. The demonstration will be worth 10% of the final grade for the project. If you do not complete the demonstration the maximum you will earn is 90/100. Note that you will need to demonstrate your program during office hours. Do not wait until the last minute to complete your demonstration!

### Implementation Details

1. It is up to you to design this program. You are strongly encouraged to visit office hours to discuss your proposed design with the instructor.
2. Use [jAudiotagger](http://www.jthink.net/jaudiotagger/) to read the ID3 tags of the MP3 files.  This will allow you to extract the artist, album, and title of the song during startup.
3. Use [JLayer](http://www.javazoom.net/javalayer/javalayer.html) for playback.  You can create a `Player` object from an `InputStream` and invoke the `play` method to begin playback.  The `close` method stops playback.
4. When invoking the `play` method to play a song, the method will not return until the song is finished playing.  In order for your program to respond to other events during playback, you will need to create a new `Thread` that invokes the play method.  
5. [`MP3Test.java`](code/MP3Test.java) demonstrates how to use the jAudioTagger and JLayer libraries.
6. To use a third-party library you will need to add the [jar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAR_(file_format)) file to your [classpath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classpath_(Java)). Here is an example of how I did that on my mac in order to run the `MP3Test` class. This example assumes that you have downloaded the libraries and placed the jar files in the same directory where your Java code is located.

```
javac -classpath jaudiotagger-2.2.6-SNAPSHOT.jar:jl1.0.1.jar MP3Test.java
java -classpath .:jaudiotagger-2.2.6-SNAPSHOT.jar:jl1.0.1.jar MP3Test
```

### Extra Credit Options

Students who complete a demonstration and make all changes required by the instructor before the deadline for the assginment may be eligible to complete extra credit features for additional points. Note that extra credit will only be assigned to students who have completed a successful demonstration *and* implemented additional features for this program. See the instructor for more information.
